## Problems Solved

### 1. Two Sum | Easy
This isn't my first time using hashmaps but my first time acknowledging what I'm using is a hashmap (I write in Python).

### 2. Add Two Numbers | Med
This is the first time I've worked with Linked Lists. I've only known of them until now.

### 9. Palindrome Number | Easy
I def overengineered this as first.

### 1317. Convert Integer to the Sum of Two No-Zero Integers
The solution was a simple one in the end. Came at it from both ends.

### 13. Roman to Integer
Before this solution, I tried looping through the characters in the string and check one element ahead to check for groups. IndexErrors were very consistent doing that, so I switched to this solution. I think there is a more efficient way to do this code without hard-coding the values in a HashMap. Linked Lists? Hmm, I think that could solve the index error issue. Will it be less efficient than this solution? not sure.
